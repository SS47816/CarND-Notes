    "## Python Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has an interesting data stucture called a \"list\" that is much more than a mere list. In fact, a Python list actually encompasses the functionality of almost every list-based data structure in this lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes a Python list is built as an array. Even though you can do many operations on a Python list with just one line of code, there's a lot of code built in to the Python language running to make that operation possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, inserting into a list is easy (happens in constant time). However, inserting into an array is O(n), since you may need to shift elements to make space for the one you're inserting, or even copy everything to a new array if you run out of space. Thus, inserting into a Python list is actually O(n), while operations that search for an element at a particular spot are O(1). You can see the runtime of other list operations [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity). \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a \"higher level\" programming language, so you can accomplish a task with little code. However, there's a lot of code built into the infrastructure in this way that causes your code to actually run much more slowly than you'd think. Keep this in the back of your mind when using Python. You likely won't need to know the details of how Python works behind the scenes in a programming interview, but you'll seem very impressive if you do! \n",
    "\n",
    "If you aren't already comfortable with Python lists, you can look through this [lesson](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists) about basic Python list manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Specifically this is the runtime of finding the length of a list using the `len()` function"

    "## 2. Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "There isn't a built-in data structure in Python that looks like a linked list. Thankfully, it's easy to make classes that represent data structures in Python! \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the code for an `Element`, which will be a single unit in a linked list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Element(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "        self.next = None\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you understand this code before moving on! We use `__init__` to initialize a new `Element`. An Element has some `value` associated with it (which could be anything—a number, a string, a character, et cetera), and it has a variable that points to the `next` element in the linked list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's set up a `LinkedList` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LinkedList(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, head=None):\n",
    "        self.head = head\n",
    "        \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is very similar—we're just establishing that a `LinkedList` is something that has a `head` `Element`, which is the first element in the list. If we establish a new `LinkedList` without a `head`, it will default to None. \n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Let's add a method to our `LinkedList` to make it a little more useful. This method will add a new `Element` to the end of our `LinkedList`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def append(self, new_element):\n",
    "        current = self.head\n",
    "        if self.head:\n",
    "            while current.next:\n",
    "                current = current.next\n",
    "            current.next = new_element\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            self.head = new_element\n",
    "            \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this part is really important, so don't rush through it. Take the code line-by-line and make sure everything makes sense. If the `LinkedList` already has a `head`, iterate through the `next` reference in every `Element` until you reach the end of the list. Set `next` for the end of the list to be the `new_element`. Alternatively, if there is no `head` already, you should just assign `new_element` to it and do nothing else.\n",
